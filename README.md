### FONT SIZE ☁️

- I DECIDED to test vw on the font-size

[<img src="/src/img/respons-fontsize.gif"/>]()

#### vw, vh and vmin

-These new properties allow you to scale font sizes according to the viewport dimensions, i.e.

- 1vw is 1% of the viewport width
- 1vh is 1% of the viewport height
- 1vmin is the smallest of 1vw and 1vh
- For example, assume your browser viewport is set to 1,000 x 1,200 pixels:

- 1.5vw = 15px font size
- 1.5vh = 18px font size
- 1.5vmin = min(1.5vw, 1.5vh) = 15px font size
- The new units will revolutionize responsive design — text on mobile devices often appears a little large because you’re holding the device closer than a monitor.

#### Browser support is a little patchy but it’s coming…

- IE10 — full support

- IE9 — supported, but vmin is named “vm”

- Chrome 22+ — full support

- Safari 6 and iOS Safari 6 — full support

- Firefox — will be implemented in version 19 (late February 2013)

- Blackberry Browser 10 — full support

> No word from Opera yet, but I suspect they’re on the case. Again, it may be advisable to use fallbacks for a few years, e.g.
